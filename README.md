Java Script based game engine similar to flappy bird

With the DOM I created a game engine that is similar to apps like flappy bird. 

In the future i would like to further design this little game and to put in more obstacles.

1) Design "Player"
2) design background
3) Add obstacles
4) let the obstacles fly
5) create unpridictability
